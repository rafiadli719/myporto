- üõ† Skills dashboard featuring animated proficiency bars and focus area highlights
- ‚úâÔ∏è Contact hub with validation-ready form, social links, and success messaging

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for fast development and bundling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling and theme theming
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for page-load, scroll, and hover animations
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for consistent iconography

## Getting Started

npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the development server at the URL provided in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173).

## Project Structure

```
src/
  components/   # Reusable UI building blocks and section layouts
  data/         # Structured data for projects and skill categories
  assets/       # Static media (currently using remote imagery)
  App.jsx       # Main application shell and theme management
```

## Accessibility & Performance Considerations

- Theme preference stored in `localStorage` and applied to the `<html>` element for reduced flashes
- Focus-visible outlines maintained across interactive elements
- Lightweight, responsive images delivered via optimised remote sources
- Animations respect motion preferences by using semantic easing and durations
